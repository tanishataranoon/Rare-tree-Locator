The Rare Tree Locator is a web-based platform designed to identify, track, and document rare and unique trees found within urban Dhaka. As the city continues to expand, many of its native or uncommon tree species face neglect and potential loss due to limited ecological awareness and the lack of accessible documentation tools. This project addresses that issue by combining technology and environmental awareness through a community-driven approach. Users can explore tree locations via an interactive map, contribute sightings with geotagged photos, and share information through blog posts. The system supports three types of users — Viewers, Contributors, and Admins, each with specific roles to ensure data quality and user engagement. Developed using Django (Python), HTML, LeafletJS, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform provides a scalable, interactive, and user-friendly solution that bridges the gap between citizens, researchers, and conservationists. Ultimately, the project promotes urban biodiversity awareness and citizen participation in preserving Dhaka’s natural heritage.
